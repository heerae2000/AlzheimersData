Interpretation for how physical activity affects alzheimers:
After performing a t-test to compare patients with and without alzheimhers and their level
of physical activity, we find the p-value to be statitistically insignificant (p > 0.05)
telling us that physical activity is not a distinguising factor between patients with and 
without alzheimers.
